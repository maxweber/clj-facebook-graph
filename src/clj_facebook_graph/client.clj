  Instead of defining the whole Facebook Graph API URL like this (client/get \"https://graph.facebook.com/me/friends\") you can
  simple write (client/get [:me :friends]) (you can also write [\"me\" \"friends\"]). It's flexible thanks to the homogeneity
  of the Facebook Graph API. When you have more than an id (here \"me\") and a connection type
  (here \"friends\"), you can also provide three or more
  keywords (or strings) like in the case of 'https://graph.facebook.com/me/videos/uploaded' for example."

  response, when you provide a map entry in the request like this one ':request :data'
  in the request map. If you like, you can also extract the paging part (':request :paging').
  If you add paging to your Facebook Graph API request through a query parameter like
  limit (see 'http://developers.facebook.com/docs/api/#reading' for details) you can also
  add the map entry ':extract :data :paging true' and you get a lazy-seq as request body, which
  automatically triggers the pagination as you walk through the seq.

  (':extract :body'). "
